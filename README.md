# Simple To do App 
A basic todo app built to learn Go (backend) and practice React (frontend) development. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, as well as mark tasks as completed. It uses PostgreSQL as the database for storing tasks.
# Technologies Used
  Backend: Go
  Frontend: React
  Database: PostgreSQL

# API Documentation
The backend provides the following API endpoints:

    GET /tasks: Get a list of all tasks
    GET /tasks/:id: Get a task by id
    POST /tasks: Create a new task
    PUT /tasks/:id: Update task details
    PATCH /tasks/:id: Mark a task as completed
    DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task


## Learning Objectives

This project is primarily designed as a platform for learning and skill enhancement:

- **Mastering Go:** Develop a solid understanding of Go programming by building the backend logic of the to-do app.
- **Enhancing React Skills:** Strengthen React frontend development skills through implementing interactive features and user interfaces.
- **Integration Proficiency:** Learn to integrate a Go backend with a React frontend and manage data flow effectively.
- **Applied Learning:** Apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world project, gaining hands-on experience and troubleshooting skills.
